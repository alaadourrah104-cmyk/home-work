// Q1
// Design an OOP model for planning trip fuel across multiple vehicle types.
// Requirements:
// - Provide a general vehicle type with encapsulated core data (private fields) and validated constructors
// (invalid â†’ print an error; keep previous values).
// - Create at least two specialized vehicle types that inherit from the general type and introduce one
// private field each affecting fuel usage, with validation.
// - Define a fuel computation method in the general type; specialized types must override it with their own
// rule.
// - In a mixed collection of vehicles, given a list of trip distances, compute total fuel per vehicle and print
// which vehicles cannot complete the route under their own constraints (you define the constraint per
// type).
